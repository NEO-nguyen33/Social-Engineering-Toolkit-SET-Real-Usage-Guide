📡 Exposing Fake Site Over the Internet (Optional)
Use ngrok to expose your phishing server to the internet:
ngrok http 80

You will get a public link like:
https://23f3-104-20-123-45.ngrok.io
Now anyone visiting that link will see your fake login page (again, lab-only).

💬 Extra Tips
Use custom web templates with SET

Combine with BeEF or evilginx for advanced phishing

SET can also:

Send spear-phishing emails

Generate QR code payloads

Perform PowerShell-based attacks (on Windows)

🔐 Defense (Blue Team Insight)
Never trust suspicious links or .exe attachments

Verify domain names and SSL certs

Use password managers and 2FA
